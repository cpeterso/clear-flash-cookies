<b>"Clear Flash Cookies"</b> automatically deletes Flash cookies ("Local Shared Objects") after Firefox exits, like the defunct "BetterPrivacy" add-on. Flash cookies can be used to create "super cookies" that recreate deleted HTTP tracking cookies. To view your existing Flash cookies, open Adobe's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Flash Storage Settings panel</a>.

<b>Warning!</b> Clearing Flash cookies may delete saved game data from Flash games (e.g. some Facebook games).

Flash cookies are less of an issue in Firefox 55+ because Flash is click-to-activate by default, but deleting Flash cookies is a good precaution. If you don't actually need Flash, consider <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/disable-or-remove-add-ons#w_how-to-disable-plugins">disabling</a> or <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/keep-flash-up-to-date-and-troubleshoot-problems#w_uninstalling-flash">uninstalling</a> it: https://support.mozilla.org/kb/disable-or-remove-add-ons#w_how-to-disable-plugins

To be totally accurate, this extension does not delete Flash cookies <i>during</i> Firefox exit, but when Firefox next launches or when you close all your Firefox windows. But the effect is the same: no Flash cookies from a previous browsing session will be persisted to your next session.
