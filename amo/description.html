<b>"Clear Flash Cookies"</b> automatically deletes Flash cookies ("Local Shared Objects") after Firefox exits, like the defunct "BetterPrivacy" add-on.

Flash cookies can be used to create "super cookies" that recreate deleted HTTP tracking cookies. This is less of an issue in Firefox 55+ because Flash is click-to-activate by default, but deleting them is a good precaution. To view your existing Flash cookies, open Adobe's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Flash Storage Settings panel</a>.

<b>Warning!</b> Clearing Flash cookies may delete saved game data from Flash games (e.g. some Facebook games).
